# MP_CNC_Calc
Mostly Printer CNC / Multitool Layout Size Calculator

This is a Visual Basic 2012 program using .net 3.5 to calculate the length of Pipe, threaded rod & belt needed
for various workspace layouts of the project: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:724999

I based these calculations from the <a href="http://public.vicious1.de/Assembly_Instructions_v0.2.pdf">Detailed Assembly Instructions</a> written by <a href="http://www.vicious1.com/forums/users/bofferle/">Bofferle</a>

I changed the belt length calculations to add 7" instead of 2", since I could not get 2" to work.  You loose about 5" of belt length at each motor.

There is also a simple Visual tab showing what your layout should look like.

If you just want the .exe for this, simplest way is to drill down or go to the url: https://github.com/geodave810/MP_CNC_Calc/blob/master/MP_CNC_Calc/MP_CNC_Calc/bin/Release/MP_CNC_Calc.exe
Then right click on View Raw & save target as
That should give you just the .exe
or
Click on the download zip button near the lower left of the screen.  Unzip the file to a folder somewhere & drill down to the folder MP_CNC_Calc-master\MP_CNC_Calc\MP_CNC_Calc\bin\Release  There you will find the .exe.

Your virus software may complain about this program since it is not well know yet.

This Machine Layout tab gives you a basic idea of what your workspace will look like relative to the machine.
