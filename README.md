# MP_CNC_Calc
Mostly Printer CNC / Multitool Layout Size Calculator

This is a Visual Basic .net program to calculate the length of Pipe, threaded rod & belt needed
for various workspace layouts of the project:http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:724999

I based these calculations from the <a href="http://public.vicious1.de/Assembly_Instructions_v0.2.pdf">Detailed Assembly Instructions</a> written by <a href="http://www.vicious1.com/forums/users/bofferle/">Bofferle</a>

I changed the belt length calculations to add 7" instead of 2", since I could not get 2" to work.  You loose about 5" of belt length at each motor.

There is also a simple Visual tab showing what your layout should look like.
